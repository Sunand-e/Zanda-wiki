### **Overview of the Tenant Model**

The Tenant model is the cornerstone of multitenancy in the eLearning Plus platform. It facilitates the separation of clients while maintaining shared infrastructure, enabling multiple organizations to operate independently within the same system.

### **Key Features and Attributes**

1.  **Unique Identification**:
    
    *   Each tenant is uniquely identified using a **UUID**. The platform does not use integer IDs to maintain uniformity and scalability.
        
2.  **Multitenancy Model**:
    
    *   Multitenancy is achieved using a **'pool' infrastructure model**, ensuring resource efficiency. However, there are opportunities to enhance security through improved query isolation mechanisms.
        

### **Relationships**

The Tenant model has notable relationships with other key entities in the platform:

1.  **One-to-Many Relationships**:
    
    *   **User Model**: Users belong to a specific tenant.
        
    *   **Group Model**: Groups are scoped to a tenant.
        
    *   **Tag Model**: Tags are defined per tenant.
        
    *   **Media Items Model**: Media items are associated with a tenant.
        
2.  **Many-to-Many Relationships**:
    
    *   **ContentItem Model**:
        
        *   Tenants can share courses or resources with other tenants.
            
        *   This relationship is facilitated through the TenantContentItems join model.
            

### **Tenant Lifecycle**

1.  **Onboarding**:
    
    *   Super Admins can onboard new tenants via an interface powered by the **GraphQL API**.
        
    *   This process includes assigning the tenant's initial settings and relationships.
        
2.  **Customizations**:
    
    *   Customizations for tenants are currently managed by the Super Admin.
        
    *   The platform supports rolling out customization capabilities to tenant admins with additional development.
        

### **Access Control and Roles**

1.  **User Roles and Capabilities**:
    
    *   Roles and capabilities are assigned at the user level.
        
    *   These capabilities can be modified on a per-tenant basis using the tenant\_setting\_roles method and the self.has\_capability? method in the User model.
        

### **Security Considerations**

*   Queries are designed to operate in the context of a tenant to ensure data isolation.
    
*   There is room for improvement in query security, which could involve additional safeguards like row-level security or stricter API filters.
    

### **Potential Enhancements**

1.  **Tenant-Level Customization by Admins**:
    
    *   Enable tenant admins to manage their own configurations without Super Admin intervention.
        
2.  **Enhanced Security**:
    
    *   Strengthen query isolation mechanisms to further secure tenant data.
        
3.  **Onboarding Automation**:
    
    *   Streamline the onboarding process with predefined templates and automated workflows for tenant creation.
