Courses are assignable and shareable.

Progress for a course is based on the progress values of its children. The structure of a course is as follows:

- **Sections**: Subdivisions of a course. Each section contains one of three types of content, often referred to as "modules" conceptually (though no "Module" class or interface exists in the codebase):

    - **Lesson**: Multimedia educational content, built using a frontend block-based course builder.
            
    - **SCORM Module**: Standardised e-learning package.
            
    - **Quiz**: Assessments to evaluate user knowledge.
