Sections are the subdivisions of a course. The reasoning behind the section in the structure of a course is so that areas of content can be grouped together under a relevant sub-title, and also to aid in future developments to allow users to be drip-fed new batches of modules (lessons, quizzes, SCORM...) in one go.

Each section may contain any number of lessons, quizzes and SCORM modules.

As content items have a 'prerequisites' field, it is possible to ensure that users complete certain other content items first, be it previous modules, a quiz, or even an entirely different course.
